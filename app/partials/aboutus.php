<p>My husband and I moved to the North Country some number of years ago from the Newburyport, MA area where I worked for Hood Canvas, sewing boat tops and cushions.</p>
<p>I have always enjoyed working with various forms of fabric. From knitting and crocheting, to designing and constructing king size custom quilts for family and friends.</p>
<p>My inspiration has come from my desire to create beutiful things and the encouragement of family members.</p>
<p>These products are all designed and hand sewn from quality materials by myself in Northern New Hampshire.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these hand sewn articles as much as I enjoy making them.</p>

<div style="color:orange;padding-bottom:15px"><strong>Quilted Wallets</strong></div>
<p>Somewhere between my copious amounts of left over quilting fabric and my desire to downsize my purse 
(for those times I didn't need to carry all that stuff); necessity met creativity and the result was a hand quilted wallet a little larger than a dollar bill.</p>
<p>The size made it easy to slip into a coat or pants pocket.  It contained 8 slots for credit cards, licenses or 
other card shaped items; a zipper compartment for keys, change and any other small items that might need corralling and a pocket for money, receipts, or checks.</p>
<p>The wallet was an instant succes with family and friends and so I now make them available to you.</p>

<p>My canvas work started with Hood Canvas, but retired with the raising of my two fine children (Who are now happy and on their own thank you).</p>
<p>Then some time ago my brother-in-law asked me to make a white canvas duffle bag for him with heavy dutty zippers. He owns a yellow jeep wrangler so I added yellow straps (a pair along the zipper opening and one on either end of the bag).
It came out very well and he was thrilled. <p>The bags are heavy duty canvas and can take a fair amount of use.</p>
